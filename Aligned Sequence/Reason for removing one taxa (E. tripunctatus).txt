

Initial Observation
---------------------

In the first phylogenetic reconstruction, the branch corresponding to E. tripunctatus was significantly longer than those of all other taxa, indicating either:
- High sequence divergence,
- Excessive missing data,
- Potential misalignment or sequencing errors.

This extreme branch length affected the overall scaling of the tree, compressing the relative visualization of other branches and complicating interpretation.

Decision to Remove E. tripunctatus
-----------------------------------

To resolve this issue, the sequence corresponding to *E. tripunctatus* was excluded from the dataset. The tree was then reconstructed using MrBayes under the same model parameters.

Outcome
-------
Upon removal of E. tripunctatus, the resulting tree displayed:
- Proportionally scaled branches,
- Improved clarity of relationships among taxa,
- High posterior support at several key nodes.

This modification enhanced the overall interpretability of the phylogeny without compromising the resolution or integrity of the remaining taxa

Conclusion
-----------
The removal of E. tripunctatus was a necessary step to ensure an accurate and representative phylogenetic analysis. Future efforts may consider re-evaluating the E. tripunctatus sequence quality or replacing it with a better-curated sequence from a reliable database.
